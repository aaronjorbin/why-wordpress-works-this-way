To 12 year old software
Most of us aren't working on 12 year old software
We can <em>learn</em> from it though
Contributing is <em>not</em> frictionless
Conflict Is <em<Natural</em>
Resolving Conflict is not
Projects <em>die</em> due to conflict
People <em>quit</em> due to Conflict
Get On The Same Page
G.R.I.P.I
<em>Goals</em>
What is everyone's Goal?
<em>Roles</em>
Is it clear what each Person's Role is? 
<em>Information</em>
Does Everyone have the information they need?
<em>Process</em>
Is the Process Clear? Is it Right?
<em>Interpersonal</em>
It's not Interpersonal
80% of the time: The cause is a Goals issue
How do we Solve Goals Issues?

Havoc Pennington [[The most important person to WordPress to core development who hasn't contributed code is @havocp #wcphilly]]
Too many preferences means you can’t find any of them. [[Essay on Understanding the cost of preferences and options http://ometer.com/preferences.html #wcphilly]]
Preferences really substantively damage QA and testing.
Preferences make integration and good UI difficult.
Preferences can confuse many users.
Auto Updates: Adding an option was never an option
Striving for <em>Simplicity</em>
Ease of Use matters
Link Manager
Link Pasting
Accessibility
